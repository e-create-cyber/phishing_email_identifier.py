This Python script is designed to help identify potential phishing emails based on the presence of common phishing keywords.

How it works:
 1)The script maintains a list of known phishing keywords.
 2) It prompts the user to paste the content of an email.
 3) It checks if any of the phishing keywords appear in the email content.
 4) If a keyword is found, the script warns the user that the email might be a phishing attempt.
 5) If no keywords are found, the script indicates that the email does not appear to be from a known phisher.

NOTE: This script provides a basic level of phishing detection. It's not foolproof and should be used in conjunction with other security measures.

To use:
 1)Run the script from your terminal.
 2)Paste the email content when prompted.
 3) The script will analyze the email and display the result.
